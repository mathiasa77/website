            <h4>Miramar Math Lab: Calculus Mentor/Tutor</h4>
            <p class="p1">
              After lectures held as San Diego Miramar College, a sister college
              to SD Mesa College, I began mentoring as a math and calculus
              tutor. Initially going for homework help I began to realize I
              really enjoyed calculus, to such a degree that I felt I could help
              others. While only a couple hours per week, tutoring gave me a
              better understanding of different ways to approach math problems;
              an incrimental piece of my education.

            <p class="p1">
              Taking this course laid the ground work for my ability to
              visualize in 3D space. The ability to model and simulate physical
              objects, using CAD software such as Solidworks, in a professional
              manner are skills I took with me through my engineering career.

              The E&M course at SD Mesa was the one of the first classes in
              college that truly boggled my mind and spurred my curiosity for
              physical phenomena. With the added challenge applied calculus,
              this class was influencial in my academic journey. Thanks
