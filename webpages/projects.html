            In the 2021 NASA Micro-G NExT Challenge, Prompt 1, collegiate-level
            teams from across the country competed to design an autonomous drone
            capable of triangulating and traversing to a distress beacon in an
            ocean environment. This mission was aimed to aide in search and
            rescue efforts for the NASA Artemis Program by delivering crew
            survival aide equiptment.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p class="p2">
          Myself and the team of 24 UC Berkeley students had our proof of
          concept design accepted and approved at the end of 2020, eliminating
          some 20 other university teams, and leaving us to compete against the
          remaining 8. Beginning in early 2021 we started construction of our
          design: the Berkeley Autonomous Emergency Responder, or BEAR. Once
          construction and testing was finished, the BEAR was sent to NASA's
          Nuetral Bouyancy Lab, NBL, in Houston, Texas to complete testing among
          NBL engineers.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
          Below you'll find a litte more information regarding the BEAR and my
          involvement as the Lead Mechanical Engineer.
        </p>
        <div id="section-design" style="margin-top: 30px">
          <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px">Design and Simulation</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          The BEAR was designed to fulfill specific mission parameters such as:
          calculate a heading given a mission specific radio frequency, traverse
          turbulant water carring a payload of rescue-specific materials (such
          as water, a first-aid kit, an inflatable life-preserver, etc), and
          visually identify and deliver the payload to the recuee(s).
        </p>
        <p>
          After spending weeks deliberating over prelimiary design ideas ranging
          from a fully submerged hull to a pontoon-style hull, a self-righting
          monohull design was selected upon engineering design considerations
          (laid out further in the design matrix linked in the SOMETHING
          document). With a length, width, and height of approx. 32in x 15.5in x
          9.5in, the main structure was to be made from a carbon-fiber and
          epoxy-resin composite.
        </p>
        <p>
          The BEAR was modelled completely in Solidworks, an industry-grade CAD
          software. In utilizing CAD we were able to accurately model weight
          distribution, bouyancy, payload organizaion, and electrical component
          integration.

          />
          <p class="p2">
            One of the central design parameters laid in the challenge
            description was that the BEAR had to structuraly withstand a 10-15
            foot drop into the water. From this, we used ANSYS finite-element
            analysis (FEA) software to simulate impact performance on the
            lower-portion of the hull shell. Gathering stress and strain
            tolerance values was vital in understanding structural rigidity
            before construction began just a few months later.
          </p>
        </div>

          />
          <p class="p2">
            The BEAR had to also support its own weight from three O-ring hooks
            at the top of the hull structure. The expected pressure resulting
            from the holes of the top hull structure and the flanges matting the
            top and bottom hull shells together were also simulated in ANSYS FEA
            software to construct an accurate prediction of stress and strain on
            the body. These simulations further validated material selection and
            interior structural bracing.

          />
          <p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-left: 30px">
            Furthermore, it was vital gather data regarding the dynamic
            performance in the water of the BEAR before contruction. This was
            done by using NUMECA's computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software
            to simulate the hydro-dynamic pressure on the hull at a variety of
            velocities and accelerations. The models gathered from this gave the
            electrical and programming team a range of values to work within
            when programming the motor thrust values.

          <h3>Manufacturing: Carbon-Fiber Composites</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          In order to meet design requirements the team had to build a drone
          that was structurally tough (the ability to absorb energy and
          plastically deform without fracture/failure) and rigid yet lightweight
          enough to fall within the design parameters. Given this, a carbon
          fiber composite material was selected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Four layers of 3k 2x2 twill 5.9oz carbon fiber cloth with a
          marine-grade epoxy resin matrix yeilded an acceptable balance between
          monitary afforability, ease of manufacturing, materials attainability,
          and mechanical effectiveness. The team was not only satisfied with the
          benefits of this material, but was rather excited to learn about how
          to manufacture composite parts and how to impliment the vacuum-bag
          process: a valuable skill I hope to apply in my professional career.
        </p>
        <div class="cont-img-split-1">
          <p class="p1">
            Manufacuring the hull structure using the vacuum-bag process meant
            that we also had to manufacture two molds for the composite to
            imprint upon. Stacked medium-density fiber wood sheets served as the
            blocks of mold material for the CNC router to carve out of. Autodesk
            Fusion 360 computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software was used to
            program the CNC router path.

          As was the Lead for the Mechanical Engineering team, some of my
          central duties were researching and leading the vacuum-bag
          processes/procedures, material allocation, and coordinating
          manufacturing sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Breifly, we had to first prepare the mold surface with PVA mold
          release liquid so the final composite could be seperated, apply
          successive of layers of pre-calculated ratios of carbon fiber cloth
          and epoxy resin, apply the low-temperature release film and
          breather/bleeder cloths, apply the vacuum bag film, and finally
          asssemble the vacuum plumbing. Sustaining a constant 11psi using a 2.5
          CFM vacuum pump we were able accomplish proper infusion of the expoxy
          resin with the carbon fiber cloth, resulting in a a rigid structure.

              Over the span of a few weeks the mechanical team was able to
              lay-up a water-tight and structurally-sound carbon fiber hull. The
              following two weeks would be spent manufacturing and fixing the
              additional hardware to the hull.

              All in all, it was a pleasure learning how to utilize this
              practice and I couldn't be more proud of the commitment the team
              put in to accomplish the mission.

            For more than half of my time at UC Berkeley as an undergrad
            transfer student I was a member of the first collegiate rocket team
            to manufacture the a functioning liquid rocket engine. The team is
            focused around our mission to be the first team in the country to
            send a liquid-propelled rocket past the Karmen line,

            Among other things, I spent most of my time working on the liquid

            differential pressure from a high-pressure tank to 'push' propellant
            and oxydizer out of lower-pressure tanks: liquid-propane (LNg) and
            liquid-oxygen (LOx) respectively. Part of my responsability was to
            model, manufacture, and test the oxydizer feed assembly. During

              In order to gather valuable data and validate engine performance,
              the engine was assembled around a cart test stand, affectionately
              named LightBulb. In following safety procedures around highly
              energetic propellants, numerous hotfire tests were conducted at
              the Friends of Amatuer Rocketry Facility, or FAR, a controlled
              environment in the mojave Desert. We learned a lot in this first
              test, but still producing nearly 600 pounds of peak mean thrust.

              Given the danger surrounding rocketry testing, that being
              maintianing a literal controlled explosion, a lot of testing had
              to be done with water, to test pintle injector atomization and
              early low-pressure leaks, and with an inert cryogenic fluid:
              liquid-nitrogen or LN2, to test for leaks and performance more
              closely resembling cryogenic, high-pressure conditions.

              It was during these sometimes late night tests that we gathered

              accuracy, capacitive fill sensor accuracy, and much more
              performance related data. Also during these tests we were able to
              simulate and practice our safety and testing procedures
              effectively in preperation for hotfires.
