            At an early age I found the notion of life and existance very
            peculiar. Without getting too existential, I believe science and
            academia to be our most trusted and tested mathods of discovering
            the world around us. I was fortunate enough to grow up in Mountain
            View, CA, down the street from NASA Ames Research Center. Going to
            school with not only the sons and daughters of Silicon Valley
            engineers but of NASA engineers presented an environment that valued
            education and STEM. A gift I would only come to appreciate as an
            adult.

          It was in my second year of community college where I decided I wanted
          to investigate the mechanisms of nature further; declaring a major in
          physics. My fascination with the natural world, that started in
          community college, grew when I was accepted and transfered into the
          Univeristy of California, Berkeley (one of the best days if my life I
          might add). Here I was led on a wild-ride through the macro and
          quantum world, feeding my mathematical appetite for knowledge.

        <h2>Early Life in Aquatics</h2>
        <p>
          In my early years I had a relatively active presence in my community.
          Around the age of 13 I started volunteering as a swim instructor at
          the City of Mountain View Eagle Pool, an experience that would lead to
          a part-time job as a lifeguard when I turned 15. Fast forward 4 years
          and here I found myself working as a headguard Head Lifeguard:
          managing a staff of 60 employees, resolving conflicts, and taking
          ownership of being a keyholder.

              There are plenty of reasons why lifeguarding is a great job but
              some of the few really stood out to me. As a young person, being
              given such a large responsability, ensuring the safety of others,
              didn't weigh on me lightly. Besides having to maintain numerous
              CPR, advanced first-aid, and other related certifications, I had
              the responsability of organizing staff trainings, maintaining pool
              chemistry, and ensure a safe environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also turns out lifeguarding was the perfect job for a student,
              something I found out in high school. I carried on lifeguarding
              throughout my coommunity college experience at the La Jolla Family
              YMCA in San Diego, working 20 hours a week and quickly getting
              promoted to head lifegaurd once again. By the time I was ready to
              transfer to a univerity I had been working as a lifeguard for
              about 7 years, and I was sad to say goodbye. All in all, it a
              central contributor to the adult I am today and I am immensely
              grateful for all the values and lessons it has tought me
              throughout the years.
