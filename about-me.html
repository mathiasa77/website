            At an early age I found the notion of life and existance very
            peculiar. Without getting too existential, I believe science and
            academia to be our most trusted and tested mathods of discovering
            the world around us. I was fortunate enough to grow up in Mountain
            View, CA, down the street from NASA Ames Research Center. Going to
            school with not only the sons and daughters of Silicon Valley
            engineers but of NASA engineers nurtured an environment that valued
            education and STEM. A gift I would only come to appreciate as an
            adult.

          As a high school student at Mountain View High I took advantage of the
          wide variety of unique classes offered like Engineering Technology I
          and II and Physics AP. Frankly, I spent the mahority of time on my
          engineering studies than anything else. Although having somewhat of a
          one track mind at the time, I knew college was an endevour I wanted to
          embark on. At the time of my graduation in 2017 I was savagely craving
          my independence, inevitably deciding to move to San Diego to begin
          college on my own.

          It was in my second year of community college where I decided I wanted
          to investigate the mechanisms of nature further; declaring a major in
          physics. My fascination with the natural world only grew when I was
          accepted and transfered into the Univeristy of California, Berkeley,
          one of the best days if my life I might add. Here I was led on a
          wild-ride through the macro and quantum world, satiating mathematical
          appetite.

          <!-- all while refining how I wanted to apply my knowledge. -->
          <!-- coming to grips with that fact that we're all standing on the shoulders of giants. -->
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
          Aside from challenging coursework, I was a member of a rocket team
          that made it abundantly clear that I knew I wanted to position my
          career where my a lot of free time had gone to:
          <i>space technology.</i>
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
          A central goal of mine is to further our understanding of space beyond
          this <i>pale blue dot.</i> I believe that through the research and
          development of space technologies we can further extend human presence
          in space, efforts of which I plan to contribute greatly throughout my
          life.

          Currently I've just returned from 3 month long sabbatical around
          Europe and I am pursuing a career in Aerospace Engineering.&nbsp; I
          will be pursuing a PhD in the former in the near future.

        <h2>Early Life in Aquatics</h2>
        <p>
          In my early years I had a relatively active presence in my community.
          Around the age of 13 I started volunteering as a swim instructor at
          the City of Mountain View Eagle Pool, an experience that would lead to
          a part-time job as a lifeguard when I turned 15. Fast forward 4 years
          and here I found myself working as a headguard Head Lifeguard:
          managing a staff of 60 employees, resolving conflicts, and taking
          ownership of being a keyholder.

            <p class="p1">
              There are plenty of reasons why lifeguarding is a great job but
              some of the few really stood out to me. As a young person, being
              given such a large responsability, ensuring the safety of others,
              didn't weigh on me lightly. Besides having to maintain numerous
              CPR, advanced first-aid, and other related certifications, I had
              the responsability of organizing staff trainings, maintaining pool
              chemistry, and ensure a safe environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also turns out lifeguarding was the perfect job for a student,
              something I found out in high school. I carried on lifeguarding
              throughout my coommunity college experience at the La Jolla Family
              YMCA in San Diego, working 20 hours a week and quickly getting
              promoted to head lifegaurd once again. By the time I was ready to
              transfer to a univerity I had been working as a lifeguard for
              about 7 years, and I was sad to say goodbye. All in all, it a
              central contributor to the adult I am today and I am immensely
              grateful for all the values and lessons it has tought me
              throughout the years.
